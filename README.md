# akashacms-adblock-checker
Adblock checker for use on AkashaCMS websites, detecting whether an advertisement has been blocked, displaying a message of your choice to the visitor.

This plugin requires wrapping your advertising code with a wrapper `div`.  It runs some JavaScript to detect if the advertisement was blocked, and then inserting a message of your choice.
